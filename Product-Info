A library for amiga specific gcc develp.
.description
This is libnix, a static (i.e. link) library for gcc 2.3.3 or above.
It's not a replacement for ixemul.library (though it's possible to
recompile most of the gcc environment with libnix) but a good thing
for amiga specific development on gcc:

* It's mostly compatible to SAS's way of handling things, i.e.
  you get even an automatic shared library opening feature and
  some other things you may miss in ixemul.library.
  This also means it's ANSI compliant.

* It doesn't need any shared libraries than normal Amiga OS ones.

* It is not copyrighted by the FSF. Therefore you neither need
  to include sources nor objects together with your executable.
  (read the GLGPL _before_ flaming on this statement)

* And it's short! I was able to compile a 492 byte 'hello, world'
  using normal main.

* It uses OS20 features whenever necessary.

To cut it short:

Use ixemul.library for porting Un*x programs, libnix for compiling
amiga-only programs and gcc becomes one of the best Amiga compilers.
